This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using machine learning and NLP techniques. The model classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This project fetches data from Kaggle, using the kaggle.json API credentials.

 Features
- Real-time Sentiment Analysis: Analyze live tweets fetched via Twitter API.
- Preprocessing: Cleans and processes tweet text for analysis.
- Model Training: Trains machine learning models on Twitter datasets.
- Data Visualization: Visualizes sentiment results using graphs and charts.

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Kaggle API for dataset retrieval
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Google Colab for cloud execution

 Installation

 Step 1: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies (including Kaggle API):
pip install kaggle 


 Step 2: Kaggle Setup
To use the Kaggle dataset:
1. Download the `kaggle.json` file from your Kaggle account.
2. Upload the `kaggle.json` file to your project.

 Step 3: Configure Kaggle API Path
Set up the Kaggle API by running the following commands:
```python
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json


 Usage
1. Run the notebook on Google Colab.
2. Upload your Kaggle API credentials (`kaggle.json`) as prompted.
3. Fetch the dataset and start the sentiment analysis by running the provided code cells.

 Dataset
- The project uses a Twitter dataset retrieved from Kaggle. You need to configure the Kaggle API with your `kaggle.json` file to access the dataset.

 Results
- The project classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

 Future Enhancements
- Model Optimization: Improve accuracy with more advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Extended Dataset: Incorporate larger datasets from multiple social media platforms for a comprehensive analysis.
